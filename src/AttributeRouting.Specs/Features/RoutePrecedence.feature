Feature: Route Precedence

Scenario: Route precedence among routes for an action using the Order property
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the RoutePrecedenceAmongRoutesController
	When I fetch the routes for the RoutePrecedenceAmongRoutes controller's Index action
	Then the 1st route's url is "Index/First"
	Then the 1st route's url is "Index/First"
	And the 2nd route's url is "Index/Second"
	And the 3rd route's url is "Index/Third"
	And the 4th route's url is "Index/Fourth"
	And the 5th route's url is "Index/Fifth"
	And the 6th route's url is "Index/Sixth"
	And the 7th route's url is "Index/Seventh"
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongRoutesController

Scenario: Route precedence among actions within a controller using the Precedence property
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the RoutePrecedenceAmongActionsController

	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongActionsController

	And the 5th route's url is "ApiRoute5"
	And the 6th route's url is "ApiRoute6"
	And the 7th route's url is "ApiRoute7"

Scenario: Route precedence set for the site using the SitePrecedence property
	# Ensure that the controller with the top route is NOT scanned first
	# MVC
	Given I have a new configuration object
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongTheSitesRoutes controller
	When I generate the routes with this configuration
	And I fetch all the routes
	Then the 1st route's url is "The-First-Route"
	Then the 2nd route's url is "Controller1/Index"
	Then the 3rd route's url is "The-Last-Route"
	# Web API
	Given I have a new configuration object
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongTheSitesRoutes controller
	When I generate the routes with this configuration
	And I fetch all the routes
	Then the 1st route's url is "The-First-Route"
	Then the 2nd route's url is "ApiController1/Get"
	Then the 3rd route's url is "The-Last-Route"

Scenario: Route precedence set via Order, Precedence, and SitePrecedence properties
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the RoutePrecedenceViaRoutePropertiesController
	When I fetch all the routes
	Then the 1st route's url is "Route1"
	And the 2nd route's url is "Route2"
	And the 3rd route's url is "Route3"
	And the 4th route's url is "Route4"
	And the 5th route's url is "Route5"
	And the 6th route's url is "Route6"
	And the 7th route's url is "Route7"
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpRoutePrecedenceViaRoutePropertiesController
	When I fetch all the routes 
	Then the 1st route's url is "ApiRoute1"

	And the 3rd route's url is "ApiRoute3"
	And the 4th route's url is "ApiRoute4"
	And the 5th route's url is "ApiRoute5"
	And the 6th route's url is "ApiRoute6"
	And the 7th route's url is "ApiRoute7"

Scenario: Route precedence among controllers added individually using the configuration api
	# MVC
	Given I have a new configuration object
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers2 controller
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers3 controller
	And I add the Mvc routes from the executing assembly
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers4 controller
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers5 controller
	When I generate the routes with this configuration
	Then the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller precede those from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers2 controller
	And the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers2 controller precede those from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers3 controller
	And the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers3 controller precede those from the StandardUsage controller
	And the routes from the StandardUsage controller precede those from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers4 controller
	And the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers4 controller precede those from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers5 controller
	And no routes follow the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers5 controller
	# Web API
	Given I have a new configuration object
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers2 controller
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers3 controller
	And I add the Http routes from the executing assembly
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers4 controller
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers5 controller
	When I generate the routes with this configuration
	Then the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller precede those from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers2 controller

	And the routes from the HttpStandardUsage controller precede those from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers4 controller
	And the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers4 controller precede those from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers5 controller
	And no routes follow the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers5 controller

Scenario: Route precedence among controllers added by base type using the configuration api
	# MVC
	Given I have a new configuration object
	And I add the routes from controllers derived from the RoutePrecedenceAmongDerivedControllersBase controller
	And I add the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
	When I generate the routes with this configuration
	Then the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongDerivedControllers1 controller precede those from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
	And the routes from the RoutePrecedenceAmongDerivedControllers2 controller precede those from the RoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
	# Web API
	Given I have a new configuration object
	And I add the routes from controllers derived from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongDerivedControllersBase controller
	And I add the routes from the HttpRoutePrecedenceAmongControllers1 controller
