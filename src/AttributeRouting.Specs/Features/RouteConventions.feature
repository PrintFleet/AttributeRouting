Feature: Route Conventions

Scenario Outline: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention
	Given I have registered the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionController
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConvention controller's <action> action
	Then the route url is "<url>"
	And the default for "controller" is "RestfulRouteConvention"
	And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:
		| action  | method | url                                |
		| Index   | GET    | RestfulRouteConvention             |
		| New     | GET    | RestfulRouteConvention/New         |
		| Create  | POST   | RestfulRouteConvention             |
		| Show    | GET    | RestfulRouteConvention/{id}        |
		| Edit    | GET    | RestfulRouteConvention/{id}/Edit   |
		| Update  | PUT    | RestfulRouteConvention/{id}        |
		| Delete  | GET    | RestfulRouteConvention/{id}/Delete |
		| Destroy | DELETE | RestfulRouteConvention/{id}        |
		| Custom  | GET    | RestfulRouteConvention/Custom      |

Scenario Outline: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention on controllers with a RoutePrefix attribute
	Given I have registered the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionPrefixController
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionPrefix controller's <action> action
	Then the route url is "<url>"
	And the default for "controller" is "RestfulRouteConventionPrefix"
	And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:
		| action  | method | url                |
		| Index   | GET    | Prefix             |
		| New     | GET    | Prefix/New         |
		| Create  | POST   | Prefix             |
		| Show    | GET    | Prefix/{id}        |
		| Edit    | GET    | Prefix/{id}/Edit   |
		| Update  | PUT    | Prefix/{id}        |
		| Delete  | GET    | Prefix/{id}/Delete |
		| Destroy | DELETE | Prefix/{id}        |
		
Scenario Outline: Generating routes using the DefaultHttpRouteConvention
	Given I have registered the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionController
	When I fetch the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConvention controller's <action> action
	Then the route url is "<url>"
	And the default for "controller" is "DefaultHttpRouteConvention"
	And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:
		| action | method | url                               |
		| GetAll | GET    | DefaultHttpRouteConvention        |
		| Get    | GET    | DefaultHttpRouteConvention/{id}   |
		| Post   | POST   | DefaultHttpRouteConvention        |
		| Put    | PUT    | DefaultHttpRouteConvention/{id}   |
		| Delete | DELETE | DefaultHttpRouteConvention/{id}   |
		| Custom | GET    | DefaultHttpRouteConvention/Custom |

	And the default for "controller" is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionPrefix"
	And the default for "action" is "<action>"
	And the route for <action> is constrained to <method> requests

	Examples:	
		| action | method | url           |
		| GetAll | GET    | Prefix        |
		| Get    | GET    | Prefix/{id}   |

		| Delete | DELETE | Prefix/{id}   |
		| Custom | GET    | Prefix/Custom |					

Scenario: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention on actions with an explicit route defined
	Given I have registered the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitRouteController
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute controller's Index action
	Then the 1st route url is "RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute"
	And the 2nd route url is "Legacy"

Scenario: Generating routes using the RestfulRouteConvention on actions with an explicit ordered route defined
	Given I have registered the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRouteController
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute controller's Index action
	Then the 1st route url is "RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute/Primary"
	And the 2nd route url is "RestfulRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute"

Scenario: Generating routes using the DefaultHttpRouteConvention on actions with an explicit route defined
	Given I have registered the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitRouteController
	When I fetch the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute controller's Get action
	Then the 1st route url is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitRoute"
	And the 2nd route url is "Legacy"

Scenario: Generating routes using the DefaultHttpRouteConvention on actions with an explicit ordered route defined
	Given I have registered the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRouteController
	When I fetch the routes for the DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute controller's Get action
	Then the 1st route url is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute/Primary"
	And the 2nd route url is "DefaultHttpRouteConventionWithExplicitOrderedRoute"

Scenario: Generating routes using the conventions that define areas on controllers
	Given I have registered the routes for the AreaRouteConventionController
	When I fetch the routes for the AreaRouteConvention controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Subjects/Index"
	And the default for "controller" is "AreaRouteConvention"
	And the default for "action" is "Index"
	And the route area is "Subjects"
