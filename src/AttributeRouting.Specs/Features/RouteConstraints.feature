Feature: Route Constraints

Scenario: Regex route constraints specified with an attribute
	Given I generate the routes defined in the subject controllers
	When I fetch the routes for the RouteConstraints controller's Index action
	Then the parameter "p1" is constrained by the pattern "\d+"
	When I fetch the routes for the ApiRouteConstraints controller's Get action
	Then the parameter "p1" is constrained by the pattern "\d+"

Scenario: Regex route constraints specified inline
	Given I generate the routes defined in the subject controllers
	When I fetch the routes for the RouteConstraints controller's InlineConstraints action
	Then the route url is "InlineConstraints/{number}/{word}/{alphanum}/{capture}"
	Then the parameter "number" is constrained by the pattern "\d+"
	Then the parameter "word" is constrained by the pattern "\w{2}"
	Then the parameter "alphanum" is constrained by the pattern "[A-Za-z0-9]*"
	Then the parameter "capture" is constrained by the pattern "(gotcha)"
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpRouteConstraints controller's InlineConstraints action
	Then the route url is "InlineConstraints/{number}/{word}/{alphanum}/{capture}"
	Then the parameter "number" is constrained by the pattern "\d+"
	Then the parameter "word" is constrained by the pattern "\w{2}"
	Then the parameter "alphanum" is constrained by the pattern "[A-Za-z0-9]*"
	Then the parameter "capture" is constrained by the pattern "(gotcha)"

Scenario Outline: Inline constraints
	Given I generate the routes defined in the subject controllers
	# MVC
	When I fetch the routes for the InlineRouteConstraints controller's <actionName> action
	Then the route url is "Inline-Constraints/<actionName>/{x}"
	And the parameter "x" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.<constraintTypeName>
	# Web API
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraints controller's <actionName> action
	Then the route url is "Http-Inline-Constraints/<actionName>/{x}"
	And the parameter "x" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.<constraintTypeName>
	Examples: 
	| actionName  | constraintTypeName       |
	| Alpha       | AlphaRouteConstraint     |
	| Int         | IntRouteConstraint       |
	| Long        | LongRouteConstraint      |
	| Float       | FloatRouteConstraint     |
	| Double      | DoubleRouteConstraint    |
	| Decimal     | DecimalRouteConstraint   |

	| MinLength   | MinLengthRouteConstraint |
	| MaxLength   | MaxLengthRouteConstraint |
	| LengthRange | LengthRouteConstraint    |
	| Min         | MinRouteConstraint       |
	| Max         | MaxRouteConstraint       |
	| Range       | RangeRouteConstraint     |
	| Regex       | RegexRouteConstraint     |
	| Compound    | IntRouteConstraint       |
	| Compound    | MaxRouteConstraint       |

Scenario: Multiple inline constraints per url segment
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the InlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the InlineRouteConstraints controller's MultipleWithinUrlSegment action
	Then the route url is "Inline-Constraints/avatar/{width}x{height}/{image}"
	And the parameter "width" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	And the parameter "height" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraintsController
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraints controller's MultipleWithinUrlSegment action
	Then the route url is "Http-Inline-Constraints/avatar/{width}x{height}/{image}"
	And the parameter "width" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint
	And the parameter "height" is constrained by an inline AttributeRouting.Web.Constraints.IntRouteConstraint

Scenario Outline: Matching inline route constraints
	# MVC
	Given I have registered the routes for the InlineRouteConstraintsController
	When a request for "Inline-Constraints/<url>" is made
	Then the <action> action <condition> matched
	# Web API
	Given I have registered the routes for the HttpInlineRouteConstraintsController
	When a request for "Http-Inline-Constraints/<url>" is made
	Then the <action> action <condition> matched
	Examples:

Scenario: Multiple routes with different constraints
	Given I generate the routes defined in the subject controllers
	When I fetch the routes for the RouteConstraints controller's MultipleRoutes action
	Then the route named "MultipleConstraints1" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d+"
	And the route named "MultipleConstraints2" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d{4}" 
	And the route named "ApiMultipleConstraints1" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d+"
	And the route named "ApiMultipleConstraints2" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d{4}"
	When I fetch the routes for the HttpRouteConstraints controller's MultipleRoutes action
	Then the route named "MultipleConstraints1" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d+"
	And the route named "MultipleConstraints2" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d{4}" 
	And the route named "ApiMultipleConstraints1" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d+"
	And the route named "ApiMultipleConstraints2" has a constraint on "p1" of "\d{4}"
