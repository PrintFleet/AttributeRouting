Feature: Using Atributes to Define Routes

Background: 
	Given I generate the routes defined in the subject controllers

Scenario: Generating routes for an action method
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulTest controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Resources"
	 And the default for "controller" is "RestfulTest"
	 And the default for "action" is "Index"
	 And the namespace is "AttributeRouting.Specs.Subjects"

Scenario: Generating routes with the restful http method attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the RestfulTest controller
	Then the route for Index is constrained to GET requests
	 And the route for Create is constrained to POST requests
	 And the route for Update is constrained to PUT requests
	 And the route for Destroy is constrained to DELETE requests

Scenario: Multiple routes for a single action
	When I fetch the routes for the Test controller's MultipleRoutes action
	Then 3 routes should be found
	 And the 1st route url is "Test/Multiple"
	 And the 2nd route url is "Test/Multiple/Routes"
	 And the 3rd route url is "Test/Multiple/Routes/Again"

Scenario: Route defaults
	When I fetch the routes for the Test controller's Default action
	Then the default for "param1" is "mapleleaf"

Scenario: Optional parameters specified with a url parameter token
	When I fetch the routes for the Test controller's OptionalParametersWithAToken action
	Then the route url is "Test/Optionals/{p1}/{p2}/{p3}"
	 And the parameter p1 is optional
	 And the parameter p2 is optional
	 And the parameter p3 is optional
	 
Scenario: Regex route constraints specified with an attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the Test controller's Constraint action
	Then the parameter "cat" is constrained by the pattern "^(kitty|meow-meow|purrbot)$"

Scenario: Multiple routes with different defaults and constraints for a single action
	When I fetch the routes for the Test controller's MultipleRoutesWithDefaultsAndConstraints action
	Then the route named "FirstDitty" has a default for "number" of 666
	 And the route named "FirstDitty" has a constraint on "number" of "^\d{4}$" 
	 And the route named "SecondDitty" has a default for "number" of 777
	 And the route named "SecondDitty" has a constraint on "number" of "^\d{1}$" 

Scenario: Generating routes with the RouteArea attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the AreaTest controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Area/Test"
	 And the data token for "area" is "Area"

Scenario: Generating routes with the RouteArea attribute on actions that specify a duplicate area prefix
	When I fetch the routes for the AreaTest controller's DuplicateArea action
	Then the route url is "Area/DuplicateArea"

Scenario: Generating nested routes with the RoutePrefix attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the NestedTest controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Parent/{parentId}/Child"

Scenario: Generating nested routes with the RoutePrefix attribute on actions that specify a duplicate prefix
	When I fetch the routes for the NestedTest controller's DuplicateNest action
	Then the route url is "Parent/{parentId}/DuplicateNest"

Scenario: Generating routes with both the RouteArea and RoutePrefix attribute
	When I fetch the routes for the NestedAreaTest controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Area/Parent/{parentId}/Child"

Scenario: Generating routes using the IsAbsoluteUrl property of the RouteAttributes
	When I fetch the routes for the AbsoluteUrlTest controller's Index action
	Then the route url is "Something/Else"

Scenario: Specifying route precedence within a controller using the RouteAttribute Precedence property
	When I fetch the routes for the RoutePrecedenceTest controller
	Then the 1st route url is "Route1"
	 And the 2nd route url is "Route2"
	 And the 3rd route url is "Route3"
	 
Scenario: Redirecting to the default route for an action using the RouteAttribute Redirect property
	When I fetch the routes for the Test controller's Redirect action
	Then the route "Test/Redirect301" redirects to "Test/Redirect"
